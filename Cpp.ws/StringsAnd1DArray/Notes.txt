- DESTRUCTOR
- Special member of your class having same name as class_name
- Destructor will always de-allocate memory
- Syntactically it will precede with tilde sign(-)
- Implicitly provided by compiler which deallocates memory allocated for object on stack
- When pointer is data-member of class, it is mandatory to implement user-defined destructor
- Object creation is top-bottom and destructor is bottom-top
- It is never overloaded

-- Copy Constructor

-Whenever object is passed compiler provides built in copy constructor

-This does member wise copy of values from all lmember from original object into copied object

-Pointers in this case refer to same memory locations

-When one of those is deallocated the other does not have a memory location causing "dangling pointer situation"                   

-Solution for Dangling Pointer
	1. const: since we are creating one object as copy of another object
	
	2.User Defined Copy Function: This will allow for assigning different memory for both
	pointers.
