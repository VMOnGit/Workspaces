## Inheritance in C++ ##
- It is a process by which one object can acquire the properties of another object
- Broad category(base class) is formed and then sub categories are formed (derived class)
- "is-a" kind of relationship/hierarchy
- Types:
- Single level  A->B
- Multi-level   A->B->C
- Multiple Inheritance C->A & C->B
- Diamond Inheritance  D->B D->C  B->A  C->A

- Syntax:
- Class derived_class:mode base_class
- Mode of inheritance has to be given as per our requirement 
- Default Mode is private
- Modes: Private, Protected, Public

Class B: Private A

- Member Intializer List
- The sequence of variables on constructor list has to same as in declaration
- Sequence of elements in MIL should be matching with the constructor of its own class
- Sequence of class in MIL does not matter
- Variables passed in MIL are the one which are in constructor list
- MIL used when const is in your parameter list or avoid unnecessary constructor calls as it will invoke parametrized constructor directly
